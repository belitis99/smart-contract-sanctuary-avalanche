/**
 * @title Governance contract
 * @dev Main point of interaction with Lotto governance

 *- Create a Proposal
  - Cancel a Proposal
  - Execute a Proposal
  - Submit Vote to a Proposal
  Available Proposal States : Pending => Active => Succeeded(/Failed) => Executed(/Expired).
  The transition  "Canceled" can appear while the State is not set as Executed/Expired
  
 *1. When the Proposal is created it has Pending state
  2. After is the time exeed the votingDelay value Proposal become Active so available for voting
  3. When the voting period is finished Proposal become or Succeeded or Failed. It depends on if the voteDifference was achived or not
  4. After the proposal was Succeeded proposal can be executed immediately. After it will be executed state turn to Executed
  5. If the executionPeriod was passed and transaction was not executed it recieve Expired state and can't be executed anymore
