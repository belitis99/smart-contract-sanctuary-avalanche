/**
 * @dev Implementation of the ERC4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[EIP-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {burn} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * CAUTION: When the vault is empty or nearly empty, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning with
 * a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
 * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
 * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may
 * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well unexpected slippage in general by
 * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
 * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].

 *
 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
